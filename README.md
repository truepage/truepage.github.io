Over 6.5 million trees were cut down to make 16 billion paper cups used by US consumers only for coffee in 2006. Guess what, overall 130 billion paper cups were used by North Americans in 2006 itself. Well this historic figure has no direct or indirect relation with our idea which is focused mainly on replacing the paper used for any kind of writing work. But now, if you’d look around your workspace, your desk – the amount of paper involved, you could deduce a better picture in your head of how many trees are cut down every year across the globe just for the piece of paper we write upon and kids make aeroplanes with (HINT: It’s not in millions).

Now, that you have the idea of the extent of the environmental impact we are talking about. We would also like to bring your attention to the amount of paperwork involved in our day to day life. Every traditional office culture especially, the government offices and other hierarchical institutions involves a generalized paperwork that can be summarised as:

1.	Pile of files gets accumulated on some clerk’s desk to get verified and validated.
2.	The pile gets transferred to some another clerk just to get her boss’s signature.
3.	The clerk gets the whole pile cleared from her boss once a day probably an hour before the day’s off.

Assuming this simple process just takes one day i.e. the person who submitted his application today morning got it cleared by the end of the day. Cool, isn’t it? You got your job done the same day. But look at the bigger picture now – If it takes 10 minutes to validate your documents, and 5 minutes for the boss to read and sign it – the present system takes 5-6 hours for 15 min job. What’s alarming is that – this system is common in every second office and it has been literally slowing down the growth of our country by 5-6 hrs every single day except on holidays of course. The kick that our policy makers has been looking for our economy and growth has been sitting all these years on some clerk’s desk.

This is what we want to solve, and not just for offices. We want to replace every paper out there, with our innovative digital solution alongside eliminating the above scene of tedious paperwork with digital model of information flow, digital authentication, digital signatures, digital billings, digital application – In simple words, we want to create an universal solution to all aspects of imaginable paper and paperwork.
